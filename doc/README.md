# Gardener's Exchange
This project involved the analysis and design of the Gardener's Exchange application, which is a platform for buying/selling/trading healthy and organically grown foods with locals in a community. This directory contains all of the documentation for the Gardener's Exchange application, including a Business Proposal and a Software Requirements Specification, both which detail an analysis and design of the application.

The Gardener's Exchange Prototype directory contains the prototype code for the web application version, which was developed after these documents were written.
